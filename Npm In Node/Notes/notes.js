//! Introduction to npm
// • npm is a popular package manager which comes bundled with Node.js.
// • It is a CLI tool used to install, update, and remove external packages.
// • You can also create your own package and publish it on npmjs.com registry.
// • Do not confuse npm CLI with npmjs.com, as it’s a registry where most of the packages of Node.js are saved.
// • There are alternative Node.js package managers registry like JSR, which we will discuss in future.
//!• Fun facts:
// • npm shouldn’t be written in capitalized form unless you have everything as capital.
// • npm doesn’t stand for Node Package Manager even though many people refer to it as that. It is a recursive bacronymic abbreviation for "npm is not a acronym"
