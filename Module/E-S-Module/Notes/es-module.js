// • ES Modules (ECMAScript Modules) allow you to use import and export syntax.They have been available in Node.js since version 12.

// • To enable ES Modules, you can either:

// • Name your file with the .mjs extension, or

// • Set "type": "module" in your package.json. (Recommended)

// • Use import and export instead of require and module.exports.

// • After Node.js v14.8, you can use top-level await when ES Modules are enabled.

// • We'll use ES Modules in this course as it's part of the ECMAScript standard and a more modern approach. Don’t worry, even if a package uses CommonJS, you can import it into ES Modules. However, importing ES Module packages into CommonJS may cause issues,as some packages have switched exclusively to ES module.
