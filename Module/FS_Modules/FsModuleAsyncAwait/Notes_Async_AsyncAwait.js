// The fs/promises module provides a promise-based API for interacting with
// the filesystem, allowing asynchronous operations to be handled using
// modern JavaScript features like async/await or .then() chains. It is part of the fs module in Node.js but designed for those who prefer promises over callback-based or synchronous methods.

//!Purpose:
// Simplifies asynchronous file operations by using promises,
// making the code more readable and modern compared to traditional
// callback-based approaches.


//!Advantages:
// No need for manual callbacks.
// Cleaner and more intuitive asynchronous workflows using async/await.
// Suitable for modern JavaScript applications.
//!Use Cases
// Reading Files asynchronously in a non-blocking way.
// Writing or Appending Data to files without blocking the event loop.
// Performing Multiple File Operations sequentially or concurrently with
// promise chaining.

//Handling Errors Gracefully with .catch() or try...catch blocks.
