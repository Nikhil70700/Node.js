//! Self Contained Code unit:
// Each file in Node.js is treated as a separate module
//Variable, function ,or objects defined in one file are not accessible in another file by default unless you explicitly export them.

//! Encapsulation:
// Node.js uses the commonJS module system (module.exports and require) to ensure the code in one file does not pollute or interface with the global scope of another file.

//This makes your code modular ,maintainable ,and easier to debug
